      <li>1)The presentation was very fast and so there was a lot of time to start on the homework.</li>
      <li>2)It seemed that the skills we learned were not entirely used for our homework.</li>
      <li>3)It was a pretty good presentation because these are skills that we will need
        to know about when we get into the workforce. Anything that clients say can get oneself 'on the
        line' and it can harm their own reputation. Therefore, keeping a calm and
    professional self is essential to making it through these kinds of situations.</li>

        1) One thing the website can do is to have the "Sign Up" button bigger.
        This will allow more users to think about making an account.
        2) Another idea is to have the website include some information or statistics
         on how they became the number one website for chickens to date.
        3) Because there is already a "Sign up" button at the bottom, it wouldn't
        make much send to have it on the navigation bar as well. So, I would change it to an "About us"
, like what many websites have. With a page that talks about the company themself,
it describes what their goals are, how many chickens have been involved online and how succuessful
the site has been (if they are the number one dating site for chickens).
4) At the top, there is already a translation for English or Bok. Therefore, I took
out the translation for "Are you ready to find love?" This will save more space and allow the
"Sign up" button to be larger, as well as add more information on what the site can offer.</li>
