<p>When I have the complementary logo put in place, the mood gives a sense of happiness and it's festive. The two colours are mostly known for its
Christmas colours, therefore people who see it will probably think that the game has a Christmas mood or theme when playing. To add on, the colours
actually look like candy, which shows that this logo is the exlanation for the game itself.</p>
<img src="monochromatic webpage.jpg"/>
<p>It looks really plain with the monochromatic logo and in a way, it makes the viewer dizzy because of the 'wheels'. This is especially when the
viewer looks at the top right and bottom left 'wheels' because of the white outline.</p>
<img src="triad webpage.jpg" />
<p>The triad logo gives a very playful website. It demonstrates the game, in a sense because. This is because as said in the presentation, blue is a
common colour and yellow gives a playful and open concept. Because the colours are primary colours, it works well for kids because in school, they
are taught to mix colours. And so, knowing these three colours are somewhat as a way to teach them in understanding how colours work and how they are created.</p>
