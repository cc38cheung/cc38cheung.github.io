<h1> Competitors</h1>
<h2>Brands</h2>
<p><div>
  <ul>
    <li>Cadbury</li>
<li>	Godiva</li>
</ul>
</div>
</p>

<h2>Strengths</h2>
<p>
They have a lot of ads and they are known world-wide (almost every country knows
them and more than 50% people buy them either for themselves or as gifts)
</p>

<h2>Weaknesses</h2>
<p>
  Just last year, Cadbury “[suffered] multi-million pound losses after sparking
  storm of protest across Britain by replacing Dairy Milk in recipe with cheaper
  chocolate”( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/12094209/Cadbury-loses-more-than-6m-in-Creme-Egg-sales-after-changing-recipe.html).
  And, Godiva gets quite a few order problems in the past, which led to less sales.

<h1>Logo Inspiration</h1>
<h2>How the logo shows what the company is about</h2>
<p>
The parrot’s colours are what brings that person in. However, the type style is
what makes the logo appear more sophisticated since it looks high-class.
</p>

<h2>Why the logo is effective for the brand</h2>
<p>
Because everyone likes sweets, the parrot is more of a sign for kids to see
it. However, for adults, the parrot is like a symbol of freedom and so when the
logo is shown, it is like a sign of calmness. It is also similar to thinking of
the chocolate as a way of taking a break from all the stress around oneself.
</p>

<h2>How the branding/logo makes us stand out</h2>
<p>
-	The logo is a bird, and that is a rare idea for a company that sells chocolate.
Therefore, it is what makes the company succeed because not only will children
want to get close, but also attract adults (because older people are interested
in new ideas/ new things).
